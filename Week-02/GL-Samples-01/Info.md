## Sample Programs from GL

- Program 01
    - Write a program to implement
        - ArrayList of type String
        - HashMap of type [String, Integer]
        - HashSet of type <String>
    - Display all the values of the above using enhanced for loop

- Program 02
    - Create a class to perform Priority Queue Implementation. Create Priority Queue object of type integer and perform following operations
        - Add elements in the priorityQueue
        - print the top element of the priority queue
        - print the size of the queue
        - print the head of the queue
        - delete an element of the queue
        - print the queue elements
        - remove all the elements of the queue at once  
        - check if the queue is empty or not

- Program 03
    - Create a class to perform Deque Implementation. Create Deque object of type integer using ArrayDeque Class and perform following operations
        - add elements to the deque
        - iinsert an element at the head
        - insert an element at the tail
        - print the deque
        - peek the first element
        - delete all the elements of deque

- Program 04
    - Write a program to perform TreeSet implementation. Create a treeSet object and perform the following operations
        - add elements to treeSet object
        - add elements to treeSet object
        - print the treeSet
        - print the elements using iterator interface
        - print the first element
        - print the last element
        - retrieve and remove the last element
        - print the size of the treeSet

- Program 05
    - Create a class to perform Array List Implementation. Create ArrayList object of type integer and perform following operations
        - Add elements in the arrayList
        - Print the size of the arrayList
        - Remove the arrayList element using index
        - Remove the arrayList element by passing the value in remove method
        - Check the size of the arrayList
        - Find the min element in the arrayList
        - Find the max element in the arrayList
        - Print all the elements using an enhanced for loop

- Program 06
    - Write a program to accept user input of type integer and store it in a linkedList. Display the entered elements in sorted order {ascending and descending both}
    - Hint
        - : { user Collections.reverseOrder to sort linked list in reverse order.}
        - Use while loop to check whether the input is an integer or not
    - Test Cases
        Enter the no:

            ```
            1
            20
            8
            6
            100
            Output
            [1,6,8,20,100]
            [100,20,8,6,1]
            ```

- Program 07
    - Write a program to perform Stack implementation of type string. Use the iterator method to print the stack elements.
